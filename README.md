Student Job Portal
Project Description
The Student Job Portal is a web application designed to help university students gain valuable experience and secure a job before or after graduation. The platform offers a range of features, including job listings, profile management, and AI-driven insights to help students improve their job prospects.

This project was built during a hackathon with a focus on creating a user-friendly platform where students can discover job opportunities, build their resumes, and get personalized advice based on AI models.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and job listings.
Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Used for building the user interface and adding interactivity to the web pages.
AWS: Utilized for cloud hosting and database management.

AI Models: Integrated AI models for analyzing resumes and providing personalized career advice to students.
